# Excel_ETL

**Project Objective** : We will be creating ETL pipeling using Excel and creating a Dashboard using this to display Sales analysis.
 1) We recieved 4 raw files from our stalkeholder which contain data from different tables such as Product, Categories, Order_details, Orders.
 2) We will create connection with these files in excel by selecting "Only Create Connection" option while loading these file directly.
 3) Then we create new query to merge Product & Categories table to create Product_Dim table and Order_details & Orders table to create Orders_Fact table.
 4) Now we will merge Product_Dim table & Orders_Fact table to create final Sales_by_Product_category table
 5) Now load this final Sales_by_Product_category table to excel
 6) Now we should be creating various charts for analysis purpose

Below is screenshot of final Dashboard
